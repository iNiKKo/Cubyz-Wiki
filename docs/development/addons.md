This page outlines a guide to creating your own addons.

---

## Basics
Everything in your addon goes in a folder with your addon's name. Depending on what content you want to add, you'll need to create one or more of the following subfolders inside.

* `biomes` - Data for biomes
* `blocks` - Textures and data for blocks
* `items` - Textures and data for items
* `models` - Models for blocks
* `particles` - Textures and data for particles
* `recipes` - Crafting recipes
* `sbb` - "Structure building blocks," data and blueprint files for the generation of structures

Most data is stored in `zig.zon` files. Data in these files are written as fields, each field prefixed by a `.`

## Biomes
Every biome is defined by a `zig.zon` file that contains all the data the world generator needs to generate it.

### `zig.zon` Fields

#### `properties: GenerationProperties`
Basic information about the biome that helps the game decide where it should be generated.

Example usage:
```zig
.properties = .{
    .cold,
    .wet,
},
```

List of valid fields:
 `.hot` / `.temperate` / `.cold`/
 `.inland` / `.land` / `.ocean`/
 `.wet` / `.neitherWetNorDry` / `.dry`/

## Items
Every item has a `zig.zon` file containing all the properties of the item.

#### `texture: texturePath`

#### `tags: []Tag`

#### `stackSize: u16`
The maximum number of this item that can be held in one slot. Default is 120.

#### `material: u16`
These are the values used for procedural tool crafting.

* `durability: f32` - The amount of durability the material provides
* `massDamage: f32` - How much damage the material provides based on its mass
* `hardnessDamage: f32` - How much damage the material provides based on its hardness
* `swingSpeed: f32` - The speed of one swing
* `textureRoughness: f32` - A pass of roughness to the texture
* `colors:` - Palette of 5 colors from darkest to lightest
* `modifiers:` - [Modifiers](Modifiers)

## Models
Cubyz loads `.glb` files for block models, which you can make in your preferred 3D modelling software (i.e. [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).) However, there are some things to keep in mind when creating your model:

* Cubyz uses Z up
* Block model UVs are mapped to a 64x64 texture with 16 texture slots:

![Block uv template faces](../images/addons/Block_uv_template_faces.png)
![Block uv template numbers](../images/addons/Block_uv_template_numbers.png)

Once you're ready to use your model ingame, split the grid into the individual textures you need, and in your block's `zig.zon`, specify the file path of your textures in the following fields:

| List of Texture Fields |
| :--- |
| `texture` (Applied to all faces) |
| `texture_top` OR `texture0` |
| `texture_bottom` OR `texture1` |
| `texture_front` OR `texture2` |
| `texture_back` OR `texture3` |
| `texture_right` OR `texture4` |
| `texture_left` OR `texture5` |
| `texture6` |
| `texture7` |
| `texture8` |
| `texture9` |
| `texture10` |
| `texture11` |
| `texture12` |
| `texture13` |
| `texture14` |
| `texture15` |

To give a block your model, specify the file path of your model in the block's `zig.zon`'s `model` field.
